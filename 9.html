<p>
Now a day, data has been specifically getting stored over clouds also known as a virtual environment, either in a hybrid cloud,
public or private cloud. A cloud database is a database that has been optimized or built for such a virtualized environment. There are various
benefits of a cloud database, some of which are the ability to pay for storage capacity and bandwidth on a per-user basis, and they provide scalability on demand, along with high availability.
A cloud database also gives enterprises the opportunity to support business applications in a software-as-a-service deployment.
