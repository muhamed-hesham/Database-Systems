<h2>DBMS</h2>
<img src="Images/DBMS.png" width="400px" height="200px">
<h3>Let us see a simple example of a university database. This database is maintaining information concerning students, 
courses, and grades in a university environment. The database is organized as five files:</h3>
<ul>
<li>- The STUDENT file stores data of each student </li>
<li>- The COURSE file stores contain data on each course.</li>
<li>- The SECTION stores the information about sections in a particular course.</li>
<li>- The GRADE file stores the grades which students receive in the various sections</li>
<li>- The TUTOR file contains information about each professor.</li>
</ul>
<h3>To define a database system:</h3>
<ol>
<li>We need to specify the structure of the records of each file by defining the different 
types of data elements to be stored in each record.</li>
<li>We can also use a coding scheme to represent the values of a data item.</li>
<li>Basically, your Database will have 5 tables with a foreign key defined amongst the various tables.</li>
</ol>
<h2>History of DBMS</h2>
<ul>
<li>- 1960 - Charles Bachman designed first DBMS system.</li>
<li>- 1970 - Codd introduced IBM'S Information Management System (IMS).</li>
<li>- 1976- Peter Chen coined and defined the Entity-relationship model also know as the ER model.</li>
<li>- 1980 - Relational Model becomes a widely accepted database component.</li>
<li>- 1985- Object-oriented DBMS develops.</li>
<li>- 1990s- Incorporation of object-orientation in relational DBMS.</li>
<li>- 1991- Microsoft ships MS access, a personal DBMS and that displaces all other personal DBMS products.</li>
<li>- 1995: First Internet database applications.</li>
<li>- 1997: XML applied to database processing. Many vendors begin to integrate XML into DBMS products.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Popular DBMS Software</h2>
<ul>
<li>- MySQL.</li>
<li>- Microsoft Access.</li>
<li>- Oracle.</li>
<li>- PostgreSQL.</li>
<li>- dBASE.</li>
<li>- FoxPro.</li>
<li>- SQLite.</li>
<li>- IBM DB2.</li>
<li>- LibreOffice Base.</li>
<li>- MariaDB.</li>
<li>- Microsoft SQL Server etc.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Advantages of DBMS</h2>
<ul>
<li>- DBMS offers a variety of techniques to store & retrieve data.</li>
<li>- DBMS serves as an efficient handler to balance the needs of multiple applications using the same data.</li>
<li>- Uniform administration procedures for data.</li>
<li>- Application programmers never exposed to details of data representation and storage.</li>
<li>- Reduced Application Development Time.</li>
<li>- A DBMS schedules concurrent access to the data in such a manner that only one user can access the same data at a time.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Disadvantage of DBMS</h2>
<ul>
<li>- Cost of Hardware and Software of a DBMS is quite high which increases the budget of your organization.</li>
<li>- Most database management systems are often complex systems, so the training for users to use the DBMS is required.</li>
<li>- In some organizations, all data is integrated into a single database which can be damaged because of electric failure or database is corrupted on the storage media.</li>
<li>- Use of the same program at a time by many users sometimes lead to the loss of some data.</li>
<li>- DBMS can't perform sophisticated calculations.</li>
