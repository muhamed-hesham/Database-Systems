<p>
A database is an organized collection of structured information,
 or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. 
 A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). 
 Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them,
 are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

<h2>What is a DataBase Management System (DBMS)?</h2>
<p>
Database Management System (DBMS) is a software for storing and retrieving users' data while considering appropriate security measures. 
It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs
the operating system to provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software to store and retrieve
data.
DBMS allows users to create their own databases as per their requirement. The term “DBMS” includes the user of the database and other 
application programs. It provides an interface between the data and the software application.

<h2>Database System Environment</h2>

and users. Hardware includes physical parts and devices, software is operating system
 and database management system, a database is a collection and procedures involves set of rules that governs
 the design and usage of database, while data is a collection of information and users may be administrators, database
